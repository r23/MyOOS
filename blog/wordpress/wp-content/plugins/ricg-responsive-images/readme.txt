Bringing automatic default responsive images to WordPress.

== Description ==

Bringing automatic default responsive images to WordPress.

This plugin works by including all available image sizes for each image upload. Whenever WordPress outputs the image through the media uploader, or whenever a featured image is generated, those sizes will be included in the image tag via the srcset attribute.

**Important notes**

* Version 3.1.0 includes important changes that make this plugin compatible with WordPress version 4.4. Upgrading is highly recommended.

* As of version 2.5.0, the plugin adds `srcset` and `sizes` attributes to images on the front end instead of adding them to the image markup saved in posts.

**Full documentation and contributor guidelines can be found on [Github](https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/wp-tevko-responsive-images)**

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. If you'd like to enable the advanced image compression feature, Please see the instructions at https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/wp-tevko-responsive-images/tree/dev#advanced-image-compression
