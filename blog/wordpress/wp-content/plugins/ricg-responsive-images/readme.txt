Bringing automatic default responsive images to WordPress.

== Description ==

Bringing automatic default responsive images to WordPress.

This plugin works by including all available image sizes for each image upload. Whenever WordPress outputs the image through the media uploader, or whenever a featured image is generated, those sizes will be included in the image tag via the srcset attribute.

**Full documentation and contributor guidelines can be found on [Github](https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/wp-tevko-responsive-images)**

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. If you'd like to enable the advanced image compression feature, Please see the instructions at https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/wp-tevko-responsive-images/tree/dev#advanced-image-compression

== Changelog ==
= 2.3.1 =
* First char no longer stripped from file name if there's no slash

= 2.3.0 =
* Improved performance of get_srcset_array
* Added advanced image compression option (available by adding hook to functions.php)
* Duplicate entires now filtered out from srcset array
* Upgrade Picturefill to 2.3.1
* Refactoring plugin JS, including a switch to ajax for updating the srcset value when the image is changed in the editor
* Now using wp_get_attachment_image_attributes filter for post thumbnails

* Adjusts the aspect ratio check in tevkori_get_srcset_array() to account for rounding variance

= 2.1.0 =
 * **This version introduces a breaking change** - there are now two functions. One returns an array of srcset values, and the other returns a string with the `srcset=".."` html needed to generate the responsive image. To retrieve the srcset array, us `tevkori_get_srcset_array( $id, $size )`
 * When the image size is changed in the post editor, the srcset values will adjust to match the change.

 * Scripts are output to footer
 * Image sizes adjusted
 * Most importantly, the srcset syntax is being used
 - Works for cropped images!
 - Backwards compatible (images added before plugin install will still be responsive)!
